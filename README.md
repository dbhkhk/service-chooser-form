# Service Chooser Form

This is a small project from [tutorialzine](http://tutorialzine.com/2013/04/services-chooser-backbone-js/) to explain how [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/#) works.

The app provide a list of services with prices. You can choose services by checking boxes, and the total price will be calculated automatically.
Originally, the app has a order feature achieved by php. Here the feature is not supported.
